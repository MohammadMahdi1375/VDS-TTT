# 🚀 Continuous Self-Improvement of Large Language Models by Test-time Training with Verifier-Driven Sample Selection

The code of our paper "Continuous Self-Improvement of Large Language Models by Test-time Training with Verifier-Driven Sample Selection"

## Overview
Learning to adapt pretrained language models to unlabeled, out‑of‑distribution data is a critical challenge, as models often falter on structurally novel reasoning tasks even while excelling within their training distribution. We introduce a new framework called VDS-TTT - Verifier‑Driven Sample Selection for Test‑Time Training to efficiently address this. We use a learned verifier to score a pool of generated responses and select only from high ranking pseudo‑labeled examples for fine-tuned adaptation. Specifically, for each input query our LLM generates $N$ candidate answers; the verifier assigns a reliability score to each, and the response with the highest confidence and above a fixed threshold is paired with its query for test‑time training. We fine‑tune only low‑rank LoRA adapter parameters, ensuring adaptation efficiency and fast convergence. Our proposed self-supervised framework is the first to synthesize verifier driven test-time training data for continuous self-improvement of the model. Experiments across three diverse benchmarks and three state‑of‑the‑art LLMs demonstrate that VDS‑TTT yields up to a 32.29% relative improvement over the base model and a 6.66% gain compared to verifier-based methods without test‑time training, highlighting its effectiveness and efficiency for on‑the‑fly large language model adaptation.
